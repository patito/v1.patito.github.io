## About

Hi mate,

My name is Paulo Leonardo Benatto (aka patito) and I'm from south Brazil. Currently I'm living in the craziest city in the Uk, Brighton. What I'm doing here? Open pan popcorn, traveling, learning English, meeting people, drinking pints and making bugs in the old continent.

I started my life in England working as busser (waiter assistant) in London, good times, but now I'm back to the dark side, making memory leaks. /o\

Currently I'm working at Brandwatch on IT team. Both are amazing, the company and my team. I'm Jr. Sysadmin and the most of my time I'm automating tasks using Python, uWSGI, Nginx (with SSL) on Debian servers. But sometimes I work with Nagios and other admin tasks.

As Open Source developer attending in projects like: libmalelf, malelf and libpenetra.
All projects were developed in C language on Linux platform in order to analyze Linux
and Windows binaries files.
